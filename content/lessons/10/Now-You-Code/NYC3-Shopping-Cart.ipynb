    "In this program you will implement an online shopping cart using a Python list of dictionary. The dictionary will contain the product name, price and quantity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should loop continually,  asking the user to enter \n",
    " - Product name\n",
    " - Product price\n",
    " - Product quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "until the user enters a product name of `'checkout'` at which time the loop should break.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time through the loop you should create a dictionary of product name, product price and product quantity then add the dictionary to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you enter `'checkout'`  the program should show:\n",
    "\n",
    " - all the items in the cart, including their quantity and price\n",
    " - and the total amount of the order, a running sum of quantity times price\n",
