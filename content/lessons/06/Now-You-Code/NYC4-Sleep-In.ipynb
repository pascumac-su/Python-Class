    "2. Why did we need to write 7 tests?\n",
    "    a. the seven tests were for each day of the week.\n",
    "3. Which code is easier to understand? Step 1 or step 4? Why? or Why not?\n",
    "    a. Step 4 because the IsWeekend statement is defined, making the code more specific by taking the function and making it more detailed.\n",
    "4. What happens when you input `'sat'` for `'Saturday'` Does it work? How can the program be improved? Does improving it affect the readability of step 4? (HINT: Abstractions!!!)\n",
    "    a. the code runs, but gives the wrong output, this can be improved by setting a valueError rule, allowing the program to read sat and sun.\n"
