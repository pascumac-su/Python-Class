    "A smore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%27more is a popular campfire treat consisting of marshmellows, chocolate bars, and graham crackers. \n",

    "- Each smore requires 1 graham cracker square. There are 32 squares in a box of graham crackers.\n",
    "- Each smore requires 1 section of chocolate. There are 24 sections of chocolate in package. \n",
    "\n",
    "So with 1 bag of marshmallows, 1 box of graham crackers, an 1 package of chocolate you can only make 24 smores (and you'll have 8 leftover crackers and 36 marshmallows).\n",

    "a. marshmallows because there will be 36 leftover while making the smores.\n",
    "2. Does the output make sense when you enter a negative prices ? Why type of error is this?\n",
    "a. The output will not make sense when you enter negative prices because the total will come back as a negative number. There will be no error because it is still the same math, but with negatives instead of regular totals. \n",
    "3. What is one way this program could be re-written to get the cost per smore lower?\n",
    "a. The cost per smore could be lowered by inserting more than a total of 24 smores. Making the denominator larger would make the equation total smaller."
