    "The big-box hardware store *House Depot* as contracted you to write an App to estimate the amount of paint required to paint a room. Given that 1 gallon of paint covers 400 square feet, you must output the number of paint cans required to paint a rectangular room.\n",

    "The program should output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- total area to be painted ( sum of each of the 4 walls)\n",
    "- the number of gallons of paint required to paint the room.\n",
