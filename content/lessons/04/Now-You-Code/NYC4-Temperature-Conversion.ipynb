    "1. What specific Python Error are we handling (please provide the name of it)?\n",
    "    a. We are handling a Value Error because if you enter words instead of a value the code will answer back with a Value Error due to the fact that it is a float, not a string.\n",
    "2. How many times must you execute this program before you can assume its correct? Explain.\n",
    "    a. you must execute the program at least three times to see if it converts farenheit to celsius and vis versa, and lastly, to see if try and except statement works.\n",
    "3. What happends when you enter a lower-cased 'f' or 'c' does it work? Does it work with both up\n",
    "per and lower cased values? How can we make it work?\n",
    "    a. it does not work with lower case letters because we would have to set another if and elif statement or some type of rule for it to run with both upper and lower case letters.\n",
    "4. What happens when you enter a value other than 'F' or 'C' for the units. If you don't like the result, how can you modify the program to handle this issue?\n",
    "    a. The code stops after that line when you enter a different value, to modify this and handle the issue we would have to set another try and except for it not accept values other than F or C"
